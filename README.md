# Unity3Dfps
An FPS in Unity 3D

This is a project that aims to eventually compete with AAA franchises such as Call of Duty and Battlefield. Our goal is to bring innovation to the industry our competitors are too afraid to bring forward. We have a Kickstarter if you would like to help fund the project. Please keep in mind that this game is not finished, so expect bugs and work-in-progress visuals.

Features that differentiate this game from other titles include:

. Dying causes the game to crash.
. An arcade machine in which you can play a platformer minigame as well as a circle clicker minigame.
. A house made of cheese with a distorted texture from Google Images.
. Poorly made particle affects.
