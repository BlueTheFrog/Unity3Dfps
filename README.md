# Unity3Dfps
An FPS in Unity 3D

This is a project that aims to compete with AAA franchises such as Call of Duty and Battlefield. Our goal is to bring innovation to the industry our competitors are too afraid to bring forward. With that in mind, we want to push the boundries of our creativity to redefine what it means to play a first person shooter.

Features that differentiate this game from other titles include:

. Dying causes the game to crash

. An arcade machine in which you can play a platformer minigame as well as a circle clicker minigame

. A house made of cheese with a distorted texture from Google Images

. Poorly made terrain also using textures from Google Images

. Poorly made particle affects

. Poorly made gun

. Multiplayer support

. Other players are floating arms and you have to guess where their hitboxes are

. The player has telekinetic powers which are used to reload the gun

Please keep in mind that this game is in early stages of development, so there are numerous things we plan on improving on. We have a Kickstarter if you would help fund our project. We encourage you to do so as we can only push to Windows platforms as of now. With your help, we will be able to export to other platforms, such as Mac, Linux, Xbox One, Playstation 4, and possibly mobile platforms.
